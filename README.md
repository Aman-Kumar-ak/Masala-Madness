## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- CORS for cross-origin requests

### Frontend
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Fetch API for data fetching

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB installed and running
- npm or yarn package manager

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will run on http://localhost:5000

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

## API Endpoints

### Categories and Dishes

- `GET /api/dishes` - Get all categories with their dishes
- `POST /api/dishes` - Create a new category
  ```json
  {
    "categoryName": "Category Name"
  }
  ```
- `PUT /api/dishes/:categoryId/dish` - Add a dish to a category
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Dish Name",
    "priceHalf": 25,
    "priceFull": 45
  }
  ```

## Key Files and Their Purposes

### Backend
- `server.js`: Main server configuration, database connection, and middleware setup
- `models/DishCategory.js`: MongoDB schema for categories and dishes
- `routes/dishRoutes.js`: API route handlers
- `scripts/addTestData.js`: Utility script to add test data

### Frontend
- `src/components/Menu.jsx`: Main menu component that displays categories and dishes
- `src/components/MenuCard.jsx`: Individual dish card component
- `src/utils/fetchCategories.js`: API integration for fetching menu data
- `src/utils/api.js`: API configuration and base URL
- `src/pages/Home.jsx`: Main page component

## Database Structure

### DishCategory Schema
```javascript
{
  categoryName: String,
  dishes: [{
    name: String,
    priceHalf: Number,
    priceFull: Number
  }]
}
```

## Adding Test Data

You can add test data using the provided script:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/addTestData.js
```

## Features
- Category-based menu organization
- Dynamic category filtering
- Responsive design
- Quantity controls for each dish
- Add to cart functionality (UI only)

## Development Notes
- Backend runs on port 5000
- Frontend runs on port 5173
- CORS is enabled for frontend-backend communication
- MongoDB connection is required for the backend to function

## Troubleshooting

1. If the frontend shows "Error fetching categories":
   - Ensure the backend server is running
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify CORS is properly configured

2. If MongoDB fails to connect:
   - Check if MongoDB service is running
   - Verify the MONGO_URI in .env file
   - Ensure network connectivity

3. If changes don't reflect:
   - Backend: The server auto-restarts with nodemon
   - Frontend: Changes hot-reload automatically

## Issue

When the date changes, the Order Number has to be reset to 0 but at present for the new Order it storing with (Previous Order Number + 1) which is need to be fixed.

## Things to do now

1. We have to work on showing Previous Orders in Frontend. In that we can see the Orders of Specific date.
2. We also have to work on Providing Excel Sheets. When admin download the Excel sheets of Specific date, data has to be fetch from the database and convert into Excel Sheet.
3. In Excel Sheets, there will be columns of OrderNumber, Date, Time, Dishes, Type(H/F) Dishes Price, Total Dish(each Price), Total Order Amount, Mode of Payment, successful/Failed.
